# homebrew-taps

[Hombrew](https://brew.sh/) is the "Missing package manager for macOS". It lets you
install, update, and version packages all through the command
line. Some of the software I write is available through homebrew. You
can add the ability to install it by typing
`brew tap EthanHolen/taps` in your terminal. Then install software by using
`brew install`. For example: `brew install rdme-gen`.
